## The Plan
The plan for this Laravel Final Project is to make a marketplace

1. Create (Add Products): <br>
The "Create" functionality will allow users with the appropriate permissions, such as shop owners or admins, to add new products to the marketplace. This process includes filling out essential product details like title, description, price, category, stock quantity, and uploading product images. Users can also set optional features like discounts, shipping options, or featured products. Upon successful submission, the product will be listed in the marketplace and available for customer viewing.

2. Read (View Products): <br>
The "Read" functionality will allow users, both registered and guest, to browse and view the products available in the marketplace. Users can filter or search through products by categories, price range, rating, or other attributes. On each product page, users will be able to see full product details, reviews from other customers, ratings, and related products. Additionally, product views can be enhanced with pagination and sorting options to improve the user experience.

3. Update (Edit Products): <br>
The "Update" functionality will allow shop owners or admins to edit product details at any time. This includes changing the product's description, price, stock availability, or images. An audit trail can be maintained to track all the changes made to the product. Admins may also be able to manage promotional deals, update discount percentages, and temporarily disable products from being displayed if necessary.

4. Delete (Remove Products): <br>
The "Delete" functionality will allow authorized users to remove products from the shop. This could be a soft delete (where the product is simply hidden from customers but retained in the database for possible future recovery) or a hard delete (where the product is completely erased from the system). Before final deletion, users can be prompted with a confirmation to avoid accidental removal


## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
